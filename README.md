* Cleaned and processed the data
* Created Barplots and scatters plots to analyze the data distribution by country and region
* Created a correlation Heat map
* Created a hierarchical clustering map
* Created K-means clusters to discover patterns within the countries 

# Introduction
Using data compiled from the CIA country fact sheet, I will seek insights into similarities between countries with exploratory data analysis and by experimenting with different amounts of clusters.

Looking at the histogram, we can see that most of the countries in this data set have a population of less than 100,000,000. Also, this histogram was limited to countries with a population less than 300,000,000 to give us a better visualization of the distribution.
